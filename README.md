# Sorting-Hat
Introducing a major update of Sorting Hat!

The app now gets almost all of its data from the internet, which means questions, choices, and sorting destinations can all be added or revised without updating the app itself. (It also means you need an internet connection to start sorting.)

The Sorting Hat is inspired by the magical object of that name in the Harry Potter series. The app presents users with questions, tracks scores associated with each choice, compares the scores associated with different destinations after completing a set number of questions, and then sorts the user into the destination with the highest score.  The settings screen gives you a few options for adjusting how the app works. The default mode is intended for adults and older kids with sufficient reading skills to read Harry Potter-level books on their own. There is also a Kid's Mode that draws from a different set of questions with image-based response choices. In either mode, there is also a setting that activates text-to-speech capabilities that are accessible by clicking on the text of questions (in either mode) and response choices (in default mode). You can also adjust the number of questions that you answer before being sorted.

I created the Sorting Hat during the summer of 2020 as a way to gain experience developing for iOS and to give my daughter a fun diversion while she was stuck at home amidst pandemic restrictions. We had just read Sorcerer's Stone and she was growing just as obsessed with the Wizarding World as her parents remain. I hope you enjoy the app as much as I've enjoyed seeing her delight (or mortification) at being sorted into the various Hogwarts houses -- and other surprising destinations.
